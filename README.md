# Tokenize, Protect & License Your Content

Turn WordPress posts into protected, licensed IP assets on [Medialane](https://medialane.io),
a Starknet-based protocol for programmable intellectual property. Only the site
admin connects a wallet. Authors are identified by their WordPress email and
never need one.

Status: the JS suite (`npm test`) and the PHP suite (`phpunit`) both pass, verified
against a live WP core test install and a real local WordPress activation. See
[Development](#development) for how that was verified.

## What it does

- Connect a Starknet wallet (Ready, Braavos) from the WordPress admin. This is
  the one wallet that signs every tokenize action on the site.
- Choose a license (Creative Commons preset, all rights reserved, or custom
  terms) and an AI training policy. Both are expanded into the trait set
  other platforms read, not stored as a plain string.
- From any post's editor, or in bulk from the Posts list, tokenize the post:
  title, body/excerpt, and featured image are pinned to IPFS, and the license
  is attached in the token metadata.
- Tokenized posts go to a wallet tied to the post author's WordPress email,
  set up automatically the first time one of their posts is tokenized. The
  author never connects anything themselves.
- Support multiple collections, with WordPress categories routed to a
  specific collection for tokenization.
- Tokenizing several posts at once from the Posts list signs one transaction
  for the whole batch, up to 25 posts. Larger selections are chunked into
  sequential batches of 25.
- A public badge appears on a tokenized post's own page, linking to its
  on-chain record so readers can verify it themselves.

## How it works

Every mint is signed by the connected wallet in the browser. The plugin
itself has no way to sign on anyone's behalf.

- **PHP** (`includes/`) stores the API key server-side, in `wp_options` or in
  a `TOKENIZE_CONTENT_API_KEY` constant in `wp-config.php`, and exposes a
  WordPress REST proxy (`/wp-json/tokenize-content/v1/*`) that forwards
  allowlisted requests to the Medialane backend with that key attached. The
  key stays on the server. Each route checks the
  `tokenize_content_tokenize_posts` capability for tokenize actions,
  `manage_options` for settings, and an `edit_post` check on any route that
  targets a specific post.
- **JavaScript** (`assets/src/`, bundled to `assets/dist/`) runs in the admin
  UI. It connects the wallet, calls the WordPress proxy to upload metadata
  and build a mint transaction, then asks the wallet to sign it. It talks to
  the proxy only, never to the Medialane backend directly.
- **Post meta** (`_tokenize_content_status`, `_tokenize_content_tx_hash`,
  `_tokenize_content_contract`, `_tokenize_content_token_id`,
  `_tokenize_content_license`) is written only by PHP. This keeps mint state
  tied to a value the server actually recorded.
- Which collections exist is never trusted from local storage. The plugin
  asks `medialane-backend`'s indexer fresh every time; WordPress only stores
  a label per contract.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- A Starknet wallet browser extension (Ready or Braavos)
- A Medialane API key ([portal.medialane.io/account](https://portal.medialane.io/account))

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. `npm install && npm run build` to produce `assets/dist/`.
3. Zip the plugin directory and upload it via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**,
   or place the directory in `wp-content/plugins/`.
4. Activate the plugin.
5. Go to **Settings → Tokenize & Protect**, paste an API key, and save it.
6. Connect the wallet that will manage tokenization for this site.
7. Open any post and use the **Tokenize & Protect** panel in the editor
   sidebar, or select posts from the Posts list and use the bulk action.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # bundles assets/src -> assets/dist with esbuild
npm test           # runs the JS test suite (vitest)
phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist   # runs the PHP test suite (requires the WP core test library)
```

To run `phpunit` locally, `WP_TESTS_DIR` needs to point at a real WordPress core
test-library checkout. `bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass>
[db-host] [wp-version]` sets one up. It needs `svn` and a reachable MySQL server.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the JS suite and the PHP suite on every push and PR.

This code has been checked against the real routes it depends on in
[`medialane-backend`](https://github.com/medialane-io/medialane-backend), and
verified with a real local WordPress activation (`wp-cli`, PHP's built-in
server, real posts, real users). What remains unverified is the actual
wallet-extension connect and sign flow in a real browser with a real
Starknet wallet. If you set one up, please open issues for anything that
doesn't work as documented.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for a closer look at the internal architecture.

## Security

- The API key is stored in `wp_options` and read only server-side, by the
  PHP REST proxy.
- The connected wallet's private key stays in the browser. The plugin only
  ever requests a signature for a transaction it shows first.
- All uploads and mint transactions go through the site's own REST proxy,
  which forwards to the Medialane backend under the site's own API key.

public issue. See the Medialane project for current contact details.
